# Netflix-Clone
Have successfully recreated the homepage of Netflix through web development. This project involved designing and coding a user interface that emulates the look and functionality of Netflix's landing page. I utilized HTML, CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. The project likely features such as a navigation menu, content cards, images, lists and buttons to resemble the Netflix experience. It's a testament to my web development abilities and attention to detail, showcasing my capability to replicate the user interface of a well-known streaming platform
